# wordle-on-demand

This is a API for a [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) clone with Polish dictionary, that can only be played "on-demand" meaning there is no global word of the day like in the original game. You can play as many games as you like.

I wrote this to practice Rust. It is heavily based on patterns from the [zero to production](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/zero-to-production) book.

The list of words that can be used as valid guesses was taken from [here](https://sjp.pl/sl/growy/).
